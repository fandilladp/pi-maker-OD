# pi-maker

### Getting Started

```bash
make && make run
```

### Flashing Your Image

[Download Etcher](http://etcher.io)

A new image file will appear in your "share" folder. Select this in Etcher and flash your SD Card and your Raspberry Pi is ready to go.

### Requirements

A local [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) environment is required in order to build an image.

Non-Mac users should install the "binfmt-support" package to build a new image. For example, Ubuntu users can run 'apt-get install binfmt-support' on the command-line.
